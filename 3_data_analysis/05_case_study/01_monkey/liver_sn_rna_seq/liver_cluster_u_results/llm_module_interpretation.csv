Functional_module_108,Progesterone-Induced Oocyte Maturation and Meiosis Regulation,"This module explores the critical role of progesterone in oocyte maturation and the regulation of meiosis in Macaca fascicularis, emphasizing pathways involving the maturation-promoting factor (MPF) and the transition through meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII). Key genes such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) are central to these processes. Research highlights the importance of MPF, composed of Cdc2 and cyclin B, which is activated by CDC25C phosphatase and regulated by phosphorylation mechanisms influenced by progesterone. Additionally, the studies illustrate how APC-mediated degradation of cyclin B is essential for MI exit, while cytostatic factors (CSF) maintain the MII arrest until fertilization. The interplay of various kinases, including Akt and MAPK signaling, underscores the intricate regulatory network that governs oocyte maturation and meiotic progression.",NA,0.92
Functional_module_149,Nuclear Receptor Signaling in Hormonal Regulation,"This module emphasizes the critical role of nuclear receptor-mediated signaling pathways in hormonal regulation, particularly focusing on steroid hormone signaling. Key genes involved include estrogen receptor 1 (ERα), retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB), and other members of the nuclear receptor family like ERRα and ERRγ. These receptors are pivotal in regulating transcriptional responses to steroid hormones, affecting processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation. The literature indicates that environmental disruptors, such as DDT and its metabolites, can activate ERRγ, demonstrating its importance in hormone signaling pathways and potential implications in cancer biology. This highlights the interconnectedness of nuclear receptors in mediating both normal physiological processes and responses to xenobiotic exposure, further underscoring their relevance in endocrine disruption and disease states.",NA,0.90
Functional_module_177,Lipid Transport and Membrane Dynamics in Cellular Function,"This module centers on the critical role of lipid transporters in maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating lipid movement across cellular membranes. Key genes involved include phospholipid scramblase 1, which promotes lipid translocation between membrane leaflets, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCA1, ABCA10, and ABCA11B), which are implicated in ATPase-coupled lipid transport mechanisms. The review highlights the significance of these proteins in various cellular processes, including membrane composition, cell signaling, and their potential involvement in pathological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Understanding the function of these lipid transporters can provide insights into their relevance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and how dysregulation may contribute to disease states.",NA,0.90
Functional_module_178,Eukaryotic Translation Initiation and Regulation,"This module focuses on the intricacies of eukaryotic translation initiation, highlighting the roles of various eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the assembly of the ribosomal preinitiation complex and the translation of mRNA into polypeptides. Key genes include eukaryotic translation initiation factors 1, 2A, 3 subunits (A, E, J, L, M), 4 gamma 1 and 2, and 5B, which collectively facilitate the binding of mRNA to the ribosome, the recruitment of initiator tRNA, and the promotion of translation termination. Insights from recent literature indicate that eIF2 is crucial for the recruitment of initiator tRNA, while eIF4F and its subunits play pivotal roles in mRNA cap recognition and ribosomal scanning. Moreover, alternative mechanisms involving eIF3d and eIF4G2 allow translation to proceed under conditions where eIF4E is inactive, suggesting a regulatory adaptability of the translation machinery in response to cellular stress. These findings underscore the complex interplay of translation factors in ensuring efficient protein synthesis, which is vital for cellular function and response to environmental cues.",NA,0.90
Functional_module_153,Circadian Regulation and Its Impact on Metabolism and Inflammation,"This module explores the intricate relationship between circadian regulation and various biological processes, particularly focusing on gene expression patterns that recur with a 24-hour rhythm. Key genes involved include NPAS2, CLOCK, CRY2, and PER2, which are crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms and influencing metabolic pathways. The literature highlights NPAS2's role in linking central and peripheral clocks, with implications for cognition and metabolism under constant light conditions. Additionally, insights from studies indicate that inflammation can disrupt the expression of circadian genes, suggesting a complex interaction between circadian biology and immune responses. Notably, melatonin's regulatory effects on circadian genes like PER2 and CRY2 demonstrate potential therapeutic avenues for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial lung disease, linking circadian disruptions to disease severity. Overall, this module emphasizes how circadian rhythms are fundamental to metabolic health and inflammatory processes.",NA,0.90
Functional_module_154,Calcium Signaling and Protein Location Maintenance,"This module emphasizes the maintenance of cellular location and calcium signaling, particularly involving ryanodine receptors and phospholipases. Key genes include ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), which plays a critical role in calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, essential for muscle contraction and cellular signaling. The phospholipase C family (PLCβ, PLCγ, PLCδ, PLCη) is crucial for generating second messengers that facilitate calcium signaling and contribute to the maintenance of specific protein locations within cells. The literature highlights the implications of RYR1 variants in calcium flow and muscle function, suggesting a broader relevance of calcium regulation in maintaining cellular homeostasis and functionality. The collective role of these genes indicates a significant intersection of calcium signaling pathways and their spatial organization, which is vital in various physiological processes.",NA,0.85
